# Pathfinder-Battle-Simulator
Run dozens or hundreds of battles between characters entered to see which ones will come out on top more often
Don't you know
You never split the party
clerics in the back
Keep those fighters hailing hearty
The wizard in the middle 
where he can shed some light
And you never let that damn thief out of sight
